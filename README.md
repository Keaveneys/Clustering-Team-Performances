This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook file created to form one half of my summative submission for the Data Science Professional Practice module for BPP. 

Please access the .ipynb file for the code used to drive this analysis, and discussion around interpretation of results. This is not a replica of the word document submission that accompanies this report, which can be found in the .docx file.
